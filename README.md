# Introduction to Machine Learning for Biomedical Image Processing

This material is designed to be an introductory educational material for people new to the image processing and machine learning scene. The notebooks will guide students through basic image processing routines and an introduction to PyTorch, from the definition of tensors to building basic models for image classification.
